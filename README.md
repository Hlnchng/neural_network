# Neural Network from Scratch using only NumPy
A neural network from scratch with no libaries except NumPy. 

This project implements a neural network from scratch using only NumPy based on the book from nnfs.io, without relying on high-level deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. It serves as an educational resource for understanding the fundamental principles of neural networks and deep learning. This neural network was then used to predict images from the fashion MNIST dataset.

## Features
- Fully connected feedforward neural network
- Customizable architecture (number of layers and neurons per layer)
- Activation functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, and Softmax
- Forward and backward propagation implementation
- Stochastic gradient descent & Vanilla gradient descent, Adam, Adagrad and RMSprop
- Support for Dropout regularisation
- Loss functions
